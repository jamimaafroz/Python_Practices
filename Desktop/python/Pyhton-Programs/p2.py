#That f before the string is short for formatted string literal â€” we just call it f-string in Python
#It lets you embed variables or expressions directly into your strings by using {} brackets.

#No need for .format() or messy string concatenation like "Hello " + name.
# This will look for the value of first_name (which is "Bro") and insert it into the string.
